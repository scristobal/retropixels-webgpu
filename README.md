# Retropixels 

A experimental 2D render and game engine, focused on raw pixel manipulation and retro effects. 

Just experimenting with WebGL2 and WebGPU, expect very rough edges. 

-   [x] Full WbGL2 support
-   [x] Limited WebGPU setup
-   [x] Full support WebGL2
-   [x] Orthogonal camera
-   [x] Sprite loading
-   [x] 2-axis + flat rotation movement control
-   [ ] Basic camera (orthogonal?) with some 3D or parallax effect
-   [x] Sprite animation (at least in infinite loop)
-   [ ] Lighting, 2D casting shadows, semi 2D normal maps
-   [ ] Multiplayer, maybe
-   [ ] Gamepad support, maybe
