# Retropixels 

A experimental 2Dish render engine, focused on raw pixel manipulation and retro effects. 

Just experimenting with WebGL2 and WebGPU, expect very rough edges. 

-   [x] WebGL2 backend
-   [x] WebGPU backend
-   [ ] Depth buffer
-   [x] Orthogonal camera
-   [x] Sprite animations
-   [x] Model position control 
-   [ ] Basic camera (orthogonal?) with some parallax effect
-   [ ] 2Dish Lighting, casting shadows, semi-normal maps
